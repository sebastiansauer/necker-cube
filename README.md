# necker-cube



<p>This study investigates attentional processes using a well-known bistabile image paradigm. Precisely, participants watch the Necker cube, a simple wire frame cube. The necker cube can be perceived in one of two perspectives. After a couple of seconds, the perspective "flips" from one perspective to the other. This flip or change in perception cannot (readily) suspended by will, although there is some variation in the inter-flip interval. For instance, the flip span has be associated with the temporal expansion of the working memory (cf. Sauer et al., 2012).</p>


The technical setup of the study is based on the online experiment software [lab.js](https://lab.js.org/) by Felix Henninger. For this purpose, a .json file is included that contains the study. Technically, this boils down to a number of html pages alongside with the JS code which does all the magic. Specifically, this allows to measure reaction time online without that the user needs to download software. The time measurement is done via the JS in the client browser.

<p>Abstract</p>
<p>The experience of the present moment is characterized by an integrative mechanism that fuses successive events into a unitary phenomenological experience with a temporal limit of about 3s. We hypothesized that proficiency of mindfulness expands the ability to stabilize an ambiguous percept in a bistable image paradigm using the Necker Cube, and that this effect is associated with individual differences in the level of mindfulness. Expanded duration of nowness as indicated by the ability to stabilize a bistable image stimulus for a longer period of time may improve cognitive resources and thus be of practical interest. In a sample of n = 38 meditators and n = 38 non-meditators, meditators showed longer duration of subjective nowness. This effect was associated with individual mindfulness levels. It is concluded that the subjective now can be longer for meditators than for non-meditators, and individual levels of mindfulness may convey this effect.
